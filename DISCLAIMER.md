# DISCLAIMER AND IMPLEMENTATION NOTICE

## 🏛️ ORIGINAL IMPLEMENTATION

**LabForCode is a completely original implementation built from scratch.**

## ❌ WHAT WE DID NOT DO

- ❌ **NO Judge0 code used** - We did not copy, fork, or derive any code from Judge0
- ❌ **NO Judge0 dependencies** - We do not use Judge0 as a library or service
- ❌ **NO GPL code** - We did not use any GPL-licensed code from Judge0
- ❌ **NO reverse engineering** - We did not decompile or reverse engineer Judge0

## ✅ WHAT WE DID DO

- ✅ **Read public documentation** - We studied Judge0's publicly available API documentation
- ✅ **Built original code** - We wrote our own implementation from scratch
- ✅ **Created compatible interface** - We designed our API to be compatible with Judge0's interface
- ✅ **Used our own license** - MIT License for our original work

## 📚 INSPIRATION VS. DERIVATION

**INSPIRATION** (Legal ✅):

- Reading public API documentation
- Understanding the interface design
- Learning from publicly available examples
- Building compatible APIs

**DERIVATION** (What we avoided ❌):

- Copying source code
- Using Judge0 as a dependency
- Forking or modifying Judge0 code
- Including GPL-licensed components

## 🔍 VERIFICATION

You can verify our clean implementation by:

1. **No Judge0 in dependencies**: Check `package.json` - no Judge0 packages
2. **Original file headers**: All files contain original code with our own headers
3. **Independent architecture**: Our tech stack (Next.js + PostgreSQL) is different from Judge0
4. **MIT License**: We use MIT, not GPL like Judge0

## 📋 LEGAL COMPLIANCE

- ✅ **No copyright infringement** - Original code only
- ✅ **No license violations** - No GPL code included
- ✅ **No trademark issues** - Judge0 mentioned only as inspiration
- ✅ **Clean room implementation** - Built independently from public specs
